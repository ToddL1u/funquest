# funquest prototype
This location-based app created a platform which enabled stores to promote their shops with games. A store could draw the userâ€™s attention by creating an instant quest and providing a reward such as a free meal or a discount. They therefore attracted users to attend the store in person. While a user played the games, they could share the store information on social media in exchange for rewards thus creating a novel mode of advertising for the store.
